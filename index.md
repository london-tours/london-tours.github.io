title: Let's London!
---

Hello, I'm Annie, a lifetime Londoner and Blue Badge[^1] tour guide. Have I introduced you to my old friend London? No? Oh well, you're in for a treat.

I love this city, from its palaces to its pigeons. Want the showstoppers? Take a look at my [bucket list]() tours. Prefer the alley less travelled? Check out my [deep cuts]() for some of my favourite hidden treats.

Have a passion of your own you'd like to explore? Let me design your day.  No theme is too niche, just [drop me an email]() to chat through your requirements. You can have a browse of some of my past custom itineraries, from Swiftie pilgrimages to the authentic [football]()[^2] matchday, on my [special interest]() page.

[^1]: It's the professional qualification for tour guiding here. It takes eighteen months, twelve exams and a LOT of walking to complete. Yes, we do get a real metal badge. It's my most prized possession. That or my beefeater rubber duck, Dylan.

[^2]: For my American friends, I mean soccer. Which perhaps I should adopt given it really is its OG name (If you're really interested, you can check out my blog post [here]()).
